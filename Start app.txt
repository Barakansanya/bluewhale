Everything looks great!Just one thing below:
-> Bloomberg-style persistent sidebar is not consistent on desktop mode, please rectify this issue. 
  In addition add elegance to it with some smooth animations on scroll,transitions to give it the feel and Jobs WOW effect consistently through out the App.
  Otherwise, build the Watchlist Page where users can see all their saved companies.
